Description: Spark 2
 This is a binary distribution of Spark 2.  This package can be installed
 alongside of an existing Spark 1 installation.  Spark executables are renamed
 to have 'spark2' in the name.  This package only installs libary files and
 executable scripts; it does not include init scripts to run Spark daemons
 in standalone mode.
