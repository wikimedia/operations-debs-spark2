Druid for Debian
----------------

This package is created from the release tarballs provided from
https://spark.apache.org/downloads.html. It does not build Spark from source.

This repository was created using git-import-orig:

  VERSION=2.1.2-bin-hadoop2.6
  gbp import-orig -u $VERSION --upstream-branch=master --debian-branch=debian ../spark-$VERSION.tgz

You should be able to import a new upstream release using the same command again.

Once you've imported the Spark 2 tarball, you need to explicitly declare all
binary files that need to be included in the package. The following command should do the trick.

  find {jars,python/lib,yarn,R} -type f -exec file {} \; | grep -v text | awk -F ':' '{print $1}' | sort > debian/source/include-binaries

Finally, to build --include-removal needs to be passed to dpkg-source so that any removed binaries
will be removed from the source package.  You can do so by passing --source-option="--include-removal"
to git-buildpackage or dpkg-buildpackage.  On a Wikimedia build server:

  GIT_PBUILDER_AUTOCONF=no DIST=jessie WIKIMEDIA=yes gbp buildpackage -sa -us -uc --git-builder=git-pbuilder --source-option="--include-removal"
